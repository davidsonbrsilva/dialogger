**Dialogger** is a fun yes-or-no question-and-answer web application built to practice UI development with CSS in React and custom event handling in JavaScript. Currently the application is only available in Portuguese (Brazil).

> **Warning:** the application gets random responses from the `https://yesno.wtf/api` api, so no response should be taken into account when making important decisions. We are not responsible for any damage that may result from its misuse. Having said that, enjoy!
